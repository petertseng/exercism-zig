# Exercism Zig Track

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/zig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/zig)

Exercism exercises in Zig.

Status:

This language has the potential to be made into an Exercism track, with a mostly straightforward process.
Please see `exercises/hello-world` as an example exercise.
Please see [Travis results](https://travis-ci.org/github/petertseng/exercism-zig) for verification.

It will be up to future maintainers to continue by adding more exercises.
