# Exercism Zig Track

[![Tests](https://github.com/exercism/zig/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/exercism/zig/actions?query=workflow%3ATests+branch%3Amaster)

Exercism exercises in Zig.

Status:

This language has the potential to be made into an Exercism track, with a mostly straightforward process.
Please see `exercises/hello-world` as an example exercise.
Please see [CI results](https://github.com/petertseng/exercism-zig/actions?query=workflow%3ATests+branch%3Amaster) for verification.

It will be up to future maintainers to continue by adding more exercises.
